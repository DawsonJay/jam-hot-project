# Jam Hot - AI-Powered Fruit Classification for Jam Making

## Project Overview

**Jam Hot** is an AI-powered web application that identifies fruits from photos and provides jam-making recipes and flavor profiles. The project demonstrates transfer learning, web scraping, and full-stack development skills for portfolio purposes.

## Core Functionality

Upload a photo of fruit → Get fruit identification + jam recipes + flavor profiles

**Focus**: Fruits only (herbs, spices, and other ingredients are not identified or profiled)

## Deployment

**Live Application**: https://jam-hot-project-production.up.railway.app

**API Endpoints**:
- `GET /` - API status and available endpoints
- `GET /health` - Health check
- `GET /recipes/titles` - Get all recipe titles
- `GET /recipes` - Get all recipes with full data
- `GET /recipes/count` - Get recipe statistics
- `GET /fruits` - Get all fruit profiles
- `POST /admin/restore-database?api_key=jam-hot-admin-2025` - Manually restore database from dump (requires API key)

## Quick Start

**1. Set up environment variables:**
```bash
# Copy the example file and update with your values
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your database credentials
```

**2. Start the database:**
```bash
./scripts/database/start-db.sh
```

**3. Connect to database:**
```bash
psql -h localhost -p 5433 -U postgres -d jam_hot
```

**4. Stop the database:**
```bash
./scripts/database/stop-db.sh
```
