Description: This strawberry jam recipe is easy to make without pectin. Packed with fruity flavor, this delicious homemade jam lets you enjoy summer all year long!...

Ingredients (3):
  1. 2 pounds fresh strawberries, hulled
  2. 4 cups white sugar
  3. ¼ cup lemon juice

Instructions (10):
  1. Gather all ingredients.
  2. Crush strawberries in a wide bowl in batches until you have 4 cups of mashed strawberries.
  3. Combine mashed strawberries, sugar, and lemon juice in a heavy-bottomed saucepan; stir over low heat until sugar is dissolved.
  4. Increase heat to high, and bring the mixture to a full rolling boil. Continue to boil, stirring often, until the mixture reaches 220 degrees F (105 degrees C).
  5. Check doneness after 10 to 15 minutes by dropping a small spoonful of jam onto a frozen plate. Let sit for 1 to 2 minutes; if jam appears to gel, it is ready. Continue cooking if jam appears thin and runny.
  6. Transfer jam into hot sterile jars, filling to within 1/4 inch of the top. Top with lids and screw rings on tightly.
  7. Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill it halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars 2 inches apart into the boiling water using a holder.
  8. Pour in more boiling water to cover jars by at least 1 inch. Bring to a rolling boil, cover, and process for 10 minutes.
  9. Remove the jars from the stockpot and let rest, several inches apart, for 12 to 24 hours. Store in a cool, dark area.
  10. Serve and enjoy!

Servings: 32 servings
Description: This strawberry freezer jam made with fresh berries is quick, easy, and delicious. Enjoy it on anything from toast to ice cream, or even milkshakes....

Ingredients (4):
  1. 4 cups halved fresh strawberries
  2. 1 ½ cups granulated sugar
  3. 1 (1.75 ounce) package dry pectin
  4. ¼ cup water

Instructions (5):
  1. Gather all ingredients.
  2. Crush strawberries using a potato masher in a large bowl. (Alternatively, pulse strawberries in a food processor until just finely chopped but not pureed.) Drain strawberries through a fine mesh strainer; reserve juice for another use. Transfer 2 cups crushed strawberries to a large bowl (reserve any extra strawberries for another use); add sugar, and stir until evenly combined. Let stand at room temperature for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
  3. Meanwhile, stir pectin and water together in a small saucepan until combined. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat; boil, stirring constantly, until a thick paste forms and pectin is fully dissolved, about 2 minutes.
  4. Stir boiling pectin-water mixture into strawberry mixture in large bowl; stir constantly for 3 minutes. To check if jam is set, coat back of a spoon with jam; run a finger through it. If jam remains separated, it is properly set. If jam runs back together, it is not set; stir until set, 3 more minutes. Pour into 2 sterilized pint-size jars or other storage containers, leaving a 1/2-inch space at the top to allow for expansion. Place tops on containers, and leave at room temperature for 24 hours.
  5. Place in refrigerator for at least 1 hour before serving, or freeze until ready to use or up to 3 months. Enjoy!
