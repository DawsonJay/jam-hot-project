  "description": "This recipe yields a very chunky, rustic jam that relies entirely on the fruit's natural pectin, in concert with sugar, lemon juice, and heat, to set perfectly. This jam works well with Blenheim apricots, or any other freestone apricot (apricots that have pits that pop out easily, rather than clinging to the flesh)."
