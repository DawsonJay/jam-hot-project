As soon as mixture reaches a full boil, cook for 1 minute, then remove from heat. Let stand 5 minutes.Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik",
      "To Check the Jam Set:Spoon 1 tablespoon (15ml) jam onto a small dish and allow to cool completely, to room temperature. Run a finger through the jam. If the jam remains separated, it is properly set; if it runs back together, it is not. If not set, add an extra 1 tablespoon lemon juice and 1 tablespoon low-sugar pectin, then return to a boil and boil for 1 minute longer. Repeat jam set test until jam is properly set.",
      "Carefully scrape any foam or scum from surface of jam. Transfer jam to clean jars, leaving 1/4 inch space at the top; seal jars. Jam can be refrigerated up to 3 weeks or frozen up to 3 months. If heat-processing jam, process for 8 minutes."
